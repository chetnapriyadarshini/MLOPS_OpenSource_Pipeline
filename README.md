# ðŸš€ Lead Scoring System for CodePro

This system is designed to automatically **score leads based on their likelihood of purchasing CodeProâ€™s course**, enabling the sales team to focus on high-quality leads and improve conversion efficiency.

## ðŸ”§ System Overview

The project is structured into three modular pipelines â€” **Data Preprocessing**, **Model Training**, and **Inference** â€” all containerized with **Docker** and orchestrated using **Apache Airflow**.
